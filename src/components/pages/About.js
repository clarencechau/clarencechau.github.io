              Software engineer with a passion for designing and programming
              full-stack websites / applications.
            </h3>
            <p>
              ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Clarence, a Software Engineer with proficiency in
              React, TypeScript, and Java, based in Toronto, Ontario. I am also
              a student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a degree in
              Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there's more to me than just academics and coding. On the
              athletic side, I'm a nationally-ranked badminton player. I've had
              the privilege of representing Canada on the junior national team
              and currently hold the second-place ranking in the country for
              Under-23 Men's Doubles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both my academic and athletic experiences have armed me with
              indispensable qualities like discipline, punctuality, and
              leadership, and I'm eager to bring them into any team setting.
            </p>

            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p>
              Over my lasts couple years of studying, I have had the opportunity
              to work as a software engineer at Aireum and Moneris. Both these
              organizations have given me valuable experiences in full-stack
              development, allowing me to work and grow my skillset while
              working with different team dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can say that after working at my previous occupations, my adept
              skills and technology I acquired from them notably lie in:

            <h4>Athletic Career</h4>
            <p>
              Having been a top national athlete since the age of 13, badminton
              has always been a big part of my life. I have gained so much
              competitive experience, friends, and transferable skills from this
              sport, I am proud to have met many accomplishments that I would
              like to share:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Currently ranked 2nd in Canada for U23 boys doubles</li>
              <li>Former member of the Canadian junior national team</li>
              <li>Ranked 2nd in Canada for U17 boys doubles</li>
              <li>Ranked 4th in Canada for U17 boys singles</li>
              <li>U17 boys doubles Ontario provincial champion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These accomplishments were forged through countless hours in the
              gym, where I relentlessly pursued self-improvement to become the
              best player I can be. This mentality is seamlessly transferable to
              my approach to coding. I invest substantial time and effort into
              learning and honing my skills, striving continually to evolve as a
              programmer.
